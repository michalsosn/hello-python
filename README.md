# hello-python
Notes from my exploration of not so basic Python features.

When I was learning Java, I had a nice experience of preparing for OCJP exam. I feel that raking through apis and 
trying to memorize them improved my proficiency quite a lot. There is apparently no Python equivalent to Oracle
certificates, but I decided to make some experiments anyway and put notes here. I will probably not be motivated
to be as meticulous as OCJP demands, but it should be worthwhile anyway.
